## Overview of Election Audit
We have been tasked by the Colorado Board of Elections to complete an election audit of a recent local congressional election. 

1.  Calculate the total number of votes cast.
2.  Get a complete list of candidates who received votes. 
3.  Get a complete list of counties where votes were recorded.
4.  Calculate the total number of votes recorded in each county.
5.  Calculate the percentage of total votes each county recorded.
6.  Determine the county with the largest voter turnout. 
7.  Calculate the total number of votes each candidate received.
8.  Calculate the percentage of votes each candidate won.
9.  Determine the winner of the election based on popular vote.

## Purpose
The purpose of this project is to perform an election audit analysis of a US Congressional precinct for certification of the election.  It was requested by Board of Elections management to use Python to automate the audit, as if this method is successful, the code that is utilized to run the audit can be used for other election audits across the state including other congressional, Senate and local elections.  Mail-in ballot, punch card and direct recording electronic voting methods are used in the district and  tabulated by the central office.  A vote count report based on this tabulated data will then be used to audit and certify the election.
